## Using LEFT JOIN twice and USING (), UNION
### Method1
WITH t1 AS
(
SELECT      *
FROM        Employees
LEFT JOIN   Salaries
USING       (employee_id)
UNION
SELECT      *
FROM        Salaries
LEFT JOIN   Employees
USING       (employee_id)
)
SELECT      employee_id
FROM        t1
WHERE       name IS NULL OR salary IS NULL
ORDER BY    employee_id ASC;

###Method 2:
Select e.employee_id from Employees e 
LEFT JOIN Salaries s 
ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id
WHERE s.salary  is NULL

UNION

Select s.employee_id from Salaries s
LEFT JOIN Employees e 
ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id
WHERE e.name is NULL

ORDER BY employee_id;


### UNION from three columns
SELECT      product_id,
            'store1' AS store,
            store1 AS price
FROM        Products
WHERE       store1 IS NOT NULL

UNION

SELECT      product_id,
            'store2' AS store,

FROM        Products
WHERE       store2 IS NOT NULL

UNION

SELECT      product_id,
            'store3' AS store,
            store3 AS price
FROM        Products
